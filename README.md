# Bayesian Deep Learning

This repository contains personal implementations of Bayesian methods and networks that have been having a lot of success and attention lately. It is intended to gain experience with working with these models.

Feel free to use any of the notebooks or models for your own code, but since this is for educational purposes I won't be actively maintaining this.
